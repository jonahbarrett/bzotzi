# Bzotzi

## Introduction

A simple bot made with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) in Typescript.
Referenced [ItzDerock's template](https://github.com/ItzDerock/discord.js-typescript-bot-core) for the initial structure, but will be straying away from it as the bot develops.

This bot is a rewrite of a previous bot made in Python and now uses Discord's new slash commands. The plan is to add more advanced and universally usable commands instead of commands specific to my server.

## Running the Bot

I am working on setting up more convenient scripts and docker files for a better dev and production experience. I will update this section as I make progress.
